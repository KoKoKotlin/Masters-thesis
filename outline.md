### 2. Simplicial Homology
 - Def: Simplicial Complex $\mathcal{K}$, Subcomplexes

 - Def: Barycentric Subdivision of a Complex
 - Def: Component Interval
 - Def: Geometric Realization $\lVert \mathcal{K} \rVert$
 - Def: Universal Property
 - Const: Free Abelian Group (with Universal Property)
 - Def: $C_n(X)$
 - Def: $\partial_n \colon C_n(X) \to C_{n-1}(X)$
 - Lemma: $B_n(X) \subseteq Z_n(X)$
 - Lemma: $\partial_{n-1} \circ \partial_n = 0$
 - Def: $Z_n(X), B_n(X)$
 - Def: $H_n(X)$ Simplicial Homology (well-defined bc of the lemma)

### 4. $L^0-Groups$ and Amenability
 - Def: $L^0$-group

 - Def: Ameanability
 - Some text about this property and the extension to extreme amenability
 - Def: Extreme Amenability
 - Def: THE graph
 - Thm: Equivalence Extreme Amenability and Bound on Chromatic numbers of Graph
 - Thm: Pestovs Characterization of Extreme Amenability

## Comments
 - somewhere group theory
 - how basic definitions
 - proof of mayer-vietoris
 - look up topology of $L^0$-group
