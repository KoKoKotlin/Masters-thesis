## Master thesis

This repository contains the markup for my master thesis submitted February 12th 2025.

### Build

There is a Makefile in the thesis folder which builds the thesis. Simply run the `make` command inside of this folder.

Needed for building:
 - make
 - biber
 - texlive

If there are any problems during the compilation process, run `make clean` once and then it should work flawlessly.
